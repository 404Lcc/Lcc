ASTAR_NO_ZIP                         ; Enable to strip out usage of the DotNetZip library. Increases serialized data size, but this is only relevant if you are using cached startup or loading serialized graphs during runtime. You can delete the Pathfinding.Ionic.Zip.Reduced dll after you have enabled this. You will have to reconfigure all graph settings after enabling.
ASTAR_FAST_NO_EXCEPTIONS             ; Needs to be enabled for the iPhone build setting Fast But No Exceptions to work.
ASTAR_GRID_NO_CUSTOM_CONNECTIONS     ; Disabling this will reduce memory usage and improve performance slightly but you will not be able to add custom connections to grid nodes using e.g the NodeLink component.
ASTAR_LEVELGRIDNODE_MORE_LAYERS      ; Increases the max number of layers for LayeredGridGraphs from 16 to 256. Increases memory usage.
ASTAR_NO_PENALTY                     ; Enabling this disables the use of penalties. Reduces memory usage.
ASTAR_NO_POOLING                     ; Disable pooling for some reason. Could be debugging or just for measuring the difference.
ASTAR_POOL_DEBUG                     ; Enables debugging of path pooling. Will log warnings and info messages about paths not beeing pooled correctly.
ASTAR_RECAST_LARGER_TILES            ; Raises the vertex count limit on recast tiles and navmesh graphs, but reduces the max number of tiles.
ProfileAstar                         ; Enables profiling of the pathfinding process.
ASTAR_UNITY_PRO_PROFILER             ; Requires ProfileAstar, profiles section of astar code which will show up in the Unity Pro Profiler.
ASTAR_LARGER_GRIDS                   ; Enables grid graphs larger than 1024x1024. This is not recommended for most users since such large grid graphs use a lot of memory and can be quite slow.
