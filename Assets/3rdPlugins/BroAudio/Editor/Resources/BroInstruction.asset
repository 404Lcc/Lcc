      cause a quality loss or unexpected behavior due to the nature of Comb Filtering.

      can set it to 0 or any other shorter value as needed."
  - Key: 11
    Value: The {0} track count should be greater than the sum of BroVirtual and the
      Max Real Voices! Click the button below to match them, or set it back to 32

  - Key: 12
    Value: 'This action cannot be undone! Please check the following instructions

  - Key: 13
    Value: Max Real Voices will determine how many sounds can be heard simultaneously

      inaudible until a Real Voice becomes available. BroVirtual tracks ensure that
      the voices returning from Virtual Voices can be controlled again.
  - Key: 15
