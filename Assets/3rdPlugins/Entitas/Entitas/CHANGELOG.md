- Context ctor signature changed. Generate to fix compiler errors.
  If you don't use the [Entitas.Roslyn plugins](http://u3d.as/NuJ) from the Unity Asset Store,
  you have to manually fix the affected generated context classes.  E.g. `Generated/Game/GameContext.cs`,
  add `() => new GameEntity()` as a last argument

```csharp
public sealed partial class GameContext : Entitas.Context<GameEntity> {

    public GameContext()
        : base(
            GameComponentsLookup.TotalComponents,
            0,
            new Entitas.ContextInfo(
                "Game",
                GameComponentsLookup.componentNames,
                GameComponentsLookup.componentTypes
            ),
            (entity) =>

#if (ENTITAS_FAST_AND_UNSAFE)
                new Entitas.UnsafeAERC(),
#else
                new Entitas.SafeAERC(entity),
#endif
            () => new GameEntity() // <---------- update here
        ) {
    }
}
```

- Release retained entities when ReactiveSystem.Execute() has an exception #812
  - This fixes spamming the Unity console with error messages

### Visual Debugging
⚙️ StringTypeDrawer now uses EditorGUILayout.DelayedTextField

### Code Generator
🆕 Added CleanupAttribute
⚠️ Renamed `UniquePrefixAttribute` to `FlagPrefixAttribute`

### Asset Store Version
🆕 Cleanup Data Providers and Code Generators

Instead of manually writing custom systems to remove components or destroy
entities, you can now use the new `[Cleanup]` attribute to automatically
generate `<Context>CleanupSystems` for you.

E.g. adding the `[Cleanup]` attribute to a `DestroyedComponent` can replace
your custom `DestroyEntitySystem`.

```csharp
[Cleanup(CleanupMode.DestroyEntity)]
public sealed class DestroyedComponent : IComponent {
}
```

There are currently two options:
- CleanupMode.DestroyEntity
- CleanupMode.RemoveComponent

`CleanupMode.DestroyEntity` will generate a system that destroys all
entities which have this component.

`CleanupMode.RemoveComponent` will generate a system that will remove
this component from all entities which have this component.

### Entitas
🆕 Added JobSystem for multi threading as a proof of concept.

```csharp
public sealed class RotateSystem : JobSystem<GameEntity> {

    public RotateSystem(GameContext context, int threads) :
        base(context.GetGroup(GameMatcher.AllOf(GameMatcher.Rotation, GameMatcher.RotationVector)), threads) {
    }

    protected override void Execute(GameEntity entity) {
        entity.rotation.value = entity.rotation.value * Quaternion.Euler(entity.rotationVector.value);
    }
}
```

Limitations:
- Don't use generated methods like Add() and Replace()
- Modify component values directly
See https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas/issues/325#issuecomment-373961878

This is not a general purpose solution for all problems. It can be used to solve certain performance intense areas in your game. It can be very useful if there's a very large number of entities that have to be processed, or if the data transformation involves heavy calulations.

⚠️ EventSystemsGenerator generates EventSystems per context now.

# 0.46.0

Please check for updates in 2 - 4 days.

This release is a maintenance release as announced here:

https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas/issues/508

As the project got more mature the Entitas repository not only contained the ECS core but also a few other
modules like Logging, Serialization, Networking, Code Generator, Common Utils and more.
The goal of this refactoring was to extract reusable modules and increase the focus of the Entitas repository
on ECS. Reusable modules have been successfully extracted to their own standalone projects. Overall, with the
increased focus that is achieved by having standalone projects I expect the quality to raise, too. This is
generally the case when you have reusable code that is battle tested in multiple different scenarios.

As mentioned in #508 those projects all have the `DesperateDevs` namespace. You maybe already know about
Desperate Devs because of the new YouTube channel where I will upload more and more Video on ECS,
best practices and Software Architecture. Subscribe if you don't want to miss future videos.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2q7q7tcrwWHu5GSGyt_JEQ

As a result of this refactoring I was able to remove a lot of noise from the Entitas repository and I could
easily fix platform depended bugs without any distraction.

<img width="385" alt="entitas-desperatedevs" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/233700/33746219-2011570a-dbbc-11e7-9631-4e8730fa7847.png">

Entitas will benefit from having the Desperate Devs dependencies as it enforces modularity and reusability.
Additionally, it will be possible to use awesome tools like TCPezy (DesperateDev.Networking) and Jenny (DesperateDevs.CodeGeneration) independently.


### Breaking changes

```


### CodeGenerator
- Displaying more prominent popup in Unity when trying to generate with compile errors #463

![entitas-codegenerator-compileerrorpopup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/233700/32519395-e8dccbdc-c40c-11e7-8a6c-08f176b23244.png)

- AssemblyResolver won't append dll to exe extension
- Changed code generator keys and removed default values
- Changed code generator cli keys and removed default values
- Added auto-import command. Use `entitas auto-import` to automatically populate Entitas.properties
- `entitas status` command will detect potential collisions, e.g. duplicate providers from the default plugins and the roslyn plugins
- `entitas fix` can resolve plugin collisions
- `entitas fix` command will tell you to press any key

### Migration
- Added migration for 0.45.0


# 0.44.0

As always, the Unity Asset Store version might take a few days to be processed and accepted by Unity.
Please check for updates in 2 - 4 days.

### Unity CodeGenerator
- Added new menu item which connects to an external code generator server instance

### CodeGenerator CLI
- Added server command
- Added client command
- Added startCodeGenerator files for macOS and Windows

### Example
Start the code generator server by double clicking `startCodeGenerator` on macOS or `startCodeGenerator.bat` on Windows, or use the terminal

```
$ mono CodeGenerator/entitas.exe server
```

You can now either use the new Unity menu item `Tools/Entitas/Generate with external Code Generator`
which connects to a running server and sends the `gen` command or connect yourself like this

```
$ mono CodeGenerator/entitas.exe client gen
```

This will connect to a running server and send the `gen` command. This is useful if you want to add your own custom commands
in your IDE like Visual Studio or Rider (or others).

Using the code generator server and client is optional but can greatly improve your workflow and
can drastically reduce the overhead of generating new files.


# 0.43.0

As always, the Unity Asset Store version might take a few days to be processed and accepted by Unity.
Please check for updates in 2 - 4 days.

### Breaking changes
The new code generator is part of `Entitas.Roslyn`. The Roslyn Plugins are now called `Entitas.Roslyn.CodeGeneration.Plugins`. If you already tested the new code generator beta, please update Entitas.properties
- `Entitas.Roslyn.CodeGeneration.Plugins`
- `Entitas.Roslyn.CodeGeneration.Plugins.ComponentDataProvider`
- `Entitas.Roslyn.CodeGeneration.Plugins.EntityIndexDataProvider`

New mandatory keys have been added to Entitas.properties. You can automatically add them by running `entitas fix`

### CodeGenerator
- Added `ICodeGeneratorCachable` to cache and share objects between multiple plugins to avoid redundant calculations
- Using the objectCache to share the AssemblyResolver between all plugins
- Added CodeGenerator to default searchPaths
- Added Unity menu item to generate with CLI

<img width="242" alt="entitas-unity-cli" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/233700/32442888-4c457022-c2fd-11e7-8665-bc9b7619e3f9.png">

### CodeGenerator CLI
- Updated New command to use preferences
- Added CLIConfig with new key `Entitas.CodeGeneration.CodeGenerator.CLI.Ignore.UnusedKeys` to add keys that should be ignored when running `entitas status` or `entitas doctor`. You can automatically ignore keys by pressing `i`

<img width="906" alt="entitas-cli-ignoreunusedkeys" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/233700/32444739-f3d660c0-c303-11e7-96ce-a111c9de2d89.png">

- Added support for custom properties files. Each command optionally accepts a path to a properties file. This way you can have multiple different configs how to run the code generator, e.g. one with the reflection-based code generator and one with the roslyn code generator.

```csharp
entitas gen My.properties
```
- Pretty CLI

### Unity
- Added Edit Button to Entitas Preferences

<img width="449" alt="entitas-preferences-editbutton" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/233700/32421256-c8e4fa88-c296-11e7-8c14-8d075444ed51.png">

### Asset Store Version
- Changed project structure. The Plugins are now called `Entitas.Roslyn.CodeGeneration.Plugins`
- Using the objectCache to share the ProjectParser between all plugins which speeds up the code generation process
- Updated all packages to latest version and downgraded all projects from .NET 4.6.1 to .NET 4.6
- Added more dependencies to remove warnings when running `entitas doctor` or `entitas gen`

<img width="640" alt="entitas-roslyn-nowarnings" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/233700/32421230-8766467a-c296-11e7-898a-0eaaa98c4e5a.png">


# 0.42.5

### General
- Refactored Preferences to fully embrace Entitas.properties and User.properties

### CodeGenerator CLI
- Added format command
- keepAlive argument which will keep the process alive. This is very useful when using the new roslyn code generator to avoid reloading the whole parsing infrastructure. Using this argument ith roslyn results in super fast generation time

```csharp
$ entitas gen -a
```


# 0.42.4

### Notes
Entitas development is back on track again and the wait is over. This is probably one of the last updates before Entitas reaches 1.0.0.
This verion has been tested successfully in combination with the new code generator that will work even when the code is not compiling.

### General
- Added support for User.properties. You can now either overwrite values sepcified in Entitas.properties or use placeholders

Create a new file called User.properties and specify the keys and values that should be overwritten.
You can also specify placeholers like this `${myPlaceholder}` and specify the key either in Entitas.properties or User.properties.
see: [Match One - Entitas.properties](https://github.com/sschmid/Match-One/blob/master/Entitas.properties)
see: [Match One - User.properties](https://github.com/sschmid/Match-One/blob/master/User.properties)

### Entitas
- Groups are now enumerable to iterate over groups circumventing the internal caching and potentially reducing memory allocations #408

```csharp
foreach (var e in group) {
  // Look closely: no group.GetEntities()
}
```

### CodeGenerator CLI
- Added commands add, set, remove, dump

### VisualDebugging
- Fixed Entitas Stats not ignoring built-in MultiReactiveSystem in systems count
- VisualDebugging only lets you add components that the entity doesn't already have
- GUI fixes

### Other
- Properties are now formatted by default for better readability
- Ensuring dependencies in build scripts

After installing please check your Entitas.properties. Due to the addition of `IConfigurable` for code generator plugins
some keys in Entitas.properties changed. `entitas.exe doctor`, `entitas.exe status` and `entitas.exe fix` can help you
fixing any issues. A new default Entitas.properties file will be created if none is found. The default Entitas.properties
should work with Unity without modification. For reference take a look at [Match-One - Entitas.properties](https://github.com/sschmid/Match-One/blob/master/Entitas.properties)

Exiting limitation mentioned in the [Entitas upgrade guide](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas/blob/master/EntitasUpgradeGuide.md) still apply (Entitas.Blueprints.CodeGeneration.Plugins is not supported in the code generator CLI)

## Top new features:
- UpdateCSProjPostProcessor will update your project.csproj. Generated methods are available immediately without switching to Unity and waiting for the project to be updated. This feels even better when using the new code generator (roslyn coming soon) where you don't even have to compile your project anymore - super fast feedback loops!
- Better out-of-the-box experience when starting a new Unity project. Everything will work without any manual setup. Just generate :)
- Great code generator CLI experience with helpful commands like `status` and `fix` which will let you modify Entitas.properties interactively

### CodeGenerator
- Added `IConfigurable` interface to easily create customizable and configurable code generator plugins
- Fixed `ignoreNamespaces` by using the new `IConfigurable` #376
- Added UpdateCSProjPostProcessor which updates project.csproj so you don't need to wait for Unity to update your project
- Greatly improved the code generator CLI. `status` and `fix` command will help you a lot to spot and fix problems in Entitas.properties

- CodeGenFile converts to unix line endings when setting fileContent #352
- Added progress indicator to code generator CLI when running with `-v` in verbose mode
- Added multiple smaller sub configs for TargetDirectory, ContextNames, Assemblies, ProjectPath, IgnoreNamespaces
- Placeholder `${myPlaceHolder}` in properties will remain even when overwriting
- Caching AssemblyResolver

### VisualDebugging
