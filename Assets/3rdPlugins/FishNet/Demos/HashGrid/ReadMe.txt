This demo displays how to setup and use the Hash

Setup:
	* Open scene as server, clientHost, or client only.
	* Press Play.

Notes:
	* Demo only works on clientHost. Real usage works with separate client and server, and clientHost.
	* Scene view can be used to see objects appear and disappear as the player object moves between grid spots.

	* See NetworkManager > HashGrid component to update hash grid settings.
	* Notice that the ObserverManager has GridCondition as a default condition.
