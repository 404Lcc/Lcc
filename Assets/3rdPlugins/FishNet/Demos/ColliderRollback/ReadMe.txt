This demo requires Fish-Networking Pro. Use of collider rollback for raycasts is displayed in this demo.

Setup:
    * Start two editors or builds.
    * Press play on each.
    * Run one as server, and the other as client.

Notes:
    * Red shows where the object was rolled back to on the server.
    * Green shows where the object actually was on server.

    * Rollback indicators in demo will not be correct when firing as clientHost.
