                 * This is however bad when the client hasn't initialized the object
                 * yet because it gives a false sense of execution order.
                 * As a result, Update or Ticks may return IsOwner as true well before OnStartClient
                 * is called. Many users rightfully create code with the assumption the client has been
                 * initialized by the time IsOwner is true.
                 *
                 * This is a double edged sword though because now IsOwner would return true
                 * within OnStartNetwork for clients only, but not for host given the client
                 * side won't be initialized yet as host. As a work around CodeAnalysis will
